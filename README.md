This structured methodology ensured a systematic development cycle leading to a highly optimized and power-efficient MAC unit using Vedic Mathematics.

## üßÆ Vedic Sutra: Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra

**Vedic Mathematics** is an ancient Indian system of mathematics based on 16 sutras (formulas) rediscovered by **Swami Bharati Krishna Tirtha**. These sutras provide simple and efficient techniques to solve complex arithmetic and algebraic problems.

The **Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Sutra** (meaning "Vertically and Crosswise") is specifically used for **fast multiplication**. This method simplifies multiplication by handling all partial products in parallel, making it highly suitable for digital hardware implementations like the MAC unit.

### üìå Key Points:
- **Parallelism Advantage**: The Urdhva Tiryagbhyam algorithm inherently supports parallel computation of partial products, reducing computational delay.
- **Reduced Complexity**: Minimizes the number of steps and intermediate carry propagation compared to traditional methods.
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to higher-bit multipliers, making it ideal for MAC units used in DSP and AI applications.

### üöÄ Steps of Urdhva Tiryagbhyam Multiplication:
1. **Draw Line Diagrams** representing the multiplication steps vertically and crosswise.
2. **Multiply digits on the two ends**, summing the product with any previous carry.
3. **For middle digits**, apply the crosswise multiplication and add the partial products together.
4. **Continue the process**, shifting from least significant digit (LSD) to most significant digit (MSD).
5. **Carry Forward**: At each step, the least significant digit is noted in the result, while the remaining becomes carry for the next stage.
6. **Final Result**: Once all steps are completed, the result is quickly derived with minimal delay.

### üìä Benefits in Digital Design:
- Faster multiplication leads to **high-speed MAC operation**.
- **Lower power consumption** due to fewer switching activities.
- **Simpler hardware architecture**, reducing area on FPGA/ASIC.
- Suitable for **real-time applications** like Digital Signal Processing, Machine Learning, and AI accelerators.
